    <h1>About the project</h1>
    <p>TV Ratings is a web-based application created to display movie ratings in a simple and accessible way. The
        platform is in its early development stage, and currently focuses exclusively on films.</p>
    <p>Our initial version doesn't include individual user accounts. For now, the data is updated collaboratively by
        the project developers â€” serving as both curators and testers of the system. </p>

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to build a community-driven platform where people can explore ratings and reviews for a wide variety
        of entertainment content. We're starting with movies, but we plan to expand to include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>TV Shows</li>
        <li>Cartoons</li>
        <li>Anime</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Stage</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Movies only</li>
        <li> No individual user accounts yet</li>
        <li> Database updated by developers</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <p>In future updates, we plan to implement a user system that will allow anyone to:
    <ul>
        <li>Create their own account
        </li>
        <li>Submit ratings and reviews</li>
        <li>
            Customize watchlists and preferences
        </li>
        <li>Contribute to a dynamic, crowd-powered platform</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
